## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds **static typing**.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add **types**.

> TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.

## Why should I use TypeScript?

JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

> TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match **before** running the code, not **while** running the code.

## How do I use TypeScript?

A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project.

Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!

## How to Setup a TypeScript + Node.js Project

▶️ [Original Blog](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/node-starter-project)

### Prequisites

- You should have Node and npm installed
- You should be familiar with Node and the npm ecosystem
- You have a code editor installed (preferably VS Code, it's the champ for TypeScript)

### Goals

In this short guide, I'll walk you through the process of creating a basic TypeScript application and compiling it. It's actually _really_ easy!

Afterwards, we'll setup a few scripts for hot-reloading in `development`, building for `production`, and running in `production`.

### About TypeScript

TypeScript, developed and appropriated labeled by Microsoft as "JavaScript that scales", is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that everything JavaScript can do, TypeScript can do (and more better).

TypeScript was primarily meant to solve two problems:

1. Provide JavaScript developers with an _optional type system_.
2. Provide JavaScript developers with the ability to utilize **planned features from future JavaScript editions** against _current JavaScript engines_.

We use TypeScript for most of the topics on this blog because it's a lot better suited for creating long-lasting software and having the compiler help catch bugs and validate types is tremendously helpful.

### Initial Setup

Let's create a folder for us to work in.

```shell
mkdir typescript-starter
cd typescript-starter
```

Next, we'll setup the project `package.json` and add the dependencies.

### Setup Node.js `package.json`

Using the `-y` flag when creating a `package.json` will simply approve all the defaults.

```shell
npm init -y
```

### Add TypeScript as a dev dependency

This probably doesn't come as a surprise ;)

```shell
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

After we install `typescript`, we get access to the command line TypeScript compiler through the `tsc` command. More on that below.

### Install ambient Node.js types for TypeScript

TypeScript has Implicit, Explicit, and Ambient types. Ambient types are types that get added to the global execution scope. Since we're using Node, it would be good if we could get type safety and auto-completion on the Node apis like `file`, `path`, `process`, etc. That's what installing the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) type definition for Node will do.

```shell
npm install @types/node --save-dev
```

[🔼 Back to top](#typescript-tutorial)

### Create a `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` is where we define the TypeScript compiler options. We can create a tsconfig with several options set.

```shell
npx tsc --init --rootDir src --outDir build \
--esModuleInterop --resolveJsonModule --lib es6 \
--module commonjs --allowJs true --noImplicitAny true
```

- `rootDir`: This is where TypeScript looks for our code. We've configured it to look in the `src/` folder. That's where we'll write our TypeScript.
- `outDir`: Where TypeScript puts our compiled code. We want it to go to a `build/` folder.
- `esModuleInterop`: If you were in the JavaScript space over the past couple of years, you might have recognized that modules systems had gotten a little bit out of control (AMD, SystemJS, ES Modules, etc). For a topic that requires a much longer discussion, if we're using `commonjs` as our module system (for Node apps, you should be), then we need this to be set to `true`.
- `resolveJsonModule`: If we use JSON in this project, this option allows TypeScript to use it.
- `lib`: This option adds ambient types to our project, allowing us to rely on features from different Ecmascript versions, testing libraries, and even the browser DOM api. We'd like to utilize some `es6` language features. This all gets compiled down to `es5`.
- `module`: `commonjs` is the standard Node module system in 2019. Let's use that.
- `allowJs`: If you're converting an old JavaScript project to TypeScript, this option will allow you to include `.js` files among `.ts` ones.
- `noImplicitAny`: In TypeScript files, don't allow a type to be unexplicitly specified. Every type needs to either have a specific type or be explicitly declared `any`. No implicit `any`s.

At this point, you should have a `tsconfig.json` that looks like this:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Basic Options */
    // "incremental": true,                   /* Enable incremental compilation */

    // "baseUrl": "./",                       /* Base directory to resolve non-absolute module names. */
    // "paths": {},                           /* A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the 'baseUrl'. */
    // "rootDirs": [],                        /* List of root folders whose combined content represents the structure of the project at runtime. */

    /* Advanced Options */
    "resolveJsonModule": true /* Include modules imported with '.json' extension */
  }
}
```

We can go ahead and clean the commented out stuff that we don't need. Our `tsconfig.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es6"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "outDir": "build",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  }
}
```

We're set to run our first TypeScript file.

### Create the `src` folder and create our first TypeScript file

```shell
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

And let's write some code.

```ts
console.log("Hello world!");
```

### Compiling our TypeScript

To compile our code, we'll need to run the `tsc` command using `npx`, the Node package executer. `tsc` will read the `tsconfig.json` in the current directory, and apply the configuration against the TypeScript compiler to generate the compiled JavaScript code.

```shell
npx tsc
```

### Our compiled code

Check out `build/index.js`, we've compiled our first TypeScript file.

```js
"use strict";
console.log("Hello world!");
```

### Useful configurations & scripts

#### Cold reloading

Cold reloading is nice for local development. In order to do this, we'll need to rely on a couple more packages: `ts-node` for running TypeScript code directly without having to wait for it be compiled, and `nodemon`, to watch for changes to our code and automatically restart when a file is changed.

```shell
npm install --save-dev ts-node nodemon
```

Add a `nodemon.json` config.

```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": ".ts,.js",
  "ignore": [],
  "exec": "npx ts-node ./src/index.ts"
}
```

And then to run the project, all we have to do is run `nodemon`. Let's add a script for that.

```shell
"start:dev": "npx nodemon"
```

By running `npm run start:dev`, `npx nodemon` will start our app using `npx ts-node ./src/index.ts`, watching for changes to `.ts` and `.js` files from within `/src`.

#### Creating production builds

In order to _clean_ and compile the project for production, we can add a `build` script.

Install `rimraf`, a cross-platform tool that acts like the `rm -rf` command (just obliterates whatever you tell it to).

```shell
npm install --save-dev rimraf
```

And then, add this to your `package.json`.

```shell
"build": "rimraf ./build && tsc"
```

Now, when we run `npm run build`, `rimraf` will remove our old `build` folder before the TypeScript compiler emits new code to `dist`.

#### Production startup script

In order to start the app in production, all we need to do is run the `build` command first, and then execute the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

The startup script looks like this.

```shell
"start": "npm run build && node build/index.js"
```

## TypeScript Simple Types

TypeScript supports some simple types (primitives) you may know. There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.

- boolean - true or false values
- number - whole numbers and floating point values
- string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"

### Type Assignment

When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:

- Explicit
- Implicit

In both examples below `firstName` is of type `string`

**Explicit** - writing out the type:

```ts
let firstName: string = "Dylan";
```

**Explicit** type assignment are easier to read and more intentional.

**Implicit** - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:

```ts
let firstName = "Dylan";
```

> **Note:** Having TypeScript "guess" the type of a value is called infer.

Implicit assignment forces TypeScript to **infer** the value.

**Implicit** type assignment are shorter, faster to type, and often used when developing and testing.

### Error In Type Assignment

TypeScript will throw an error if data types do not match.

```ts
let firstName: string = "Dylan"; // type string
firstName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type
```

**Implicit** type assignment would have made firstName less noticeable as a string, but both will throw an error:

```ts
let firstName = "Dylan"; // inferred to type string
firstName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type
```

**JavaScript** will **not** throw an error for mismatched types.

### Unable to Infer

TypeScript may not always properly infer what the type of a variable may be. In such cases, it will set the type to `any` which disables type checking.

```ts
// Implicit any as JSON.parse doesn't know what type of data it returns so it can be "any" thing...
const json = JSON.parse("55");
// Most expect json to be an object, but it can be a string or a number like this example
console.log(typeof json);
```

This behavior can be disabled by enabling `noImplicitAny` as an option in a TypeScript's project `tsconfig.json`. That is a JSON config file for customizing how some of TypeScript behaves.

> **Note:** you may see primitive types capitalized like Boolean. `boolean !== Boolean`
> For this tutorial just know to use the lower-cased values, the upper-case ones are for very specific circumstances.

[🔼 Back to top](#typescript-tutorial)

## TypeScript Special Types

TypeScript has special types that may not refer to any specific type of data.

### Type: any

`any` is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.

The example below does not use `any` and will throw an error:

```ts
/**
 * Example `without any`
 **/
let u = true;
u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
Math.round(u); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

Setting `any` to the special type `any` disables type checking:

```ts
/**
 * Example `with any`
 **/
let v: any = true;
v = "string"; // no error as it can be "any" type
Math.round(v); // no error as it can be "any" type
```

> `any` can be a useful way to get past errors since it disables type checking, but TypeScript will not be able provide type safety, and tools which rely on type data, such as auto completion, will not work. Remember, it should be avoided at "any" cost...

### Type: unknown

`unknown` is a similar, but safer alternative to `any`.

TypeScript will prevent `unknown` types from being used, as shown in the below example:

```ts
let w: unknown = 1;
w = "string"; // no error
w = {
  runANonExistentMethod: () => {
    console.log("I think therefore I am");
  },
} as { runANonExistentMethod: () => void };
// How can we avoid the error for the code commented out below when we don't know the type?
// w.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
if (typeof w === "object" && w !== null) {
  (w as { runANonExistentMethod: Function }).runANonExistentMethod();
}
// Although we have to cast multiple times we can do a check in the if to secure our type and have a safer casting
```

Compare the example above to the previous example, with `any`.

> `unknown` is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. To add a type later, you'll need to cast it. Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say property or variable is of the casted type.

### Type: never

`never` effectively throws an error whenever it is defined.

```ts
let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.
```

> `never` is rarely used, especially by itself, its primary use is in advanced generics.

### Type: undefined & null

`undefined` and `null` are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives `undefined` and `null` respectively.

```ts
let y: undefined = undefined;
let z: null = null;
```

> These types don't have much use unless `strictNullChecks` is enabled in the `tsconfig.json` file.

## TypeScript Arrays

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing arrays.

Read more about arrays in our [JavaScript Array chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp).

```ts
const names: string[] = [];
names.push("Dylan"); // no error
// names.push(3); // Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

### Readonly

The `readonly` keyword can prevent arrays from being changed.

```ts
const names: readonly string[] = ["Dylan"];
names.push("Jack"); // Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
// try removing the readonly modifier and see if it works?
```

### Type Inference

TypeScript can infer the type of an array if it has values.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // inferred to type number[]
numbers.push(4); // no error
// comment line below out to see the successful assignment
numbers.push("2"); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
let head: number = numbers[0]; // no error
```
